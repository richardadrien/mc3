talk: "Community detection in directed graphs using stationary distribution 
and hitting times methods (with Tien Dat Dang, Duy Hieu Do)"
abstract: "Community detection has been extensively developed using various
algorithms. One of the most powerful algorithms for undirected graphs
is Walktrap, which determines the distance between vertices by
employing random walk and evaluates clusters using modularity based on
vertex degrees. Although several directions have been explored to
extend this method to directed graphs, none of them have been
effective. In this paper, we investigate the Walktrap algorithm (Pons
and Latapy in J Graph Algorithms Appl 10:191–218, 2006) and the
spectral method (Newman in Phys Rev E 88:042822, 2013) and extend them
to directed graphs. We propose a novel approach in which the distance
between vertices is defined using hitting time, and modularity is
computed based on the stationary distribution of a random walk. These
definitions are highly effective, as algorithms for hitting time and
stationary distribution have been developed, allowing for good
computational complexity. Our proposed method is particularly useful
for directed graphs, with the well-known results for undirected graphs
being special cases. Additionally, we utilize the spectral method for
these problems, and we have implemented our algorithms to demonstrate
their plausibility and effectiveness."

talk: "Verification of Square Lattices with Various Neighborhoods by Infinite Petri Nets"
abstract: "Different types of square lattice abstract structures with various 
neighborhoods and edge conditions are basic constructs in many real-life areas 
like telecommunications, computing, nanotechnologies, and biological systems. 
Detailed models of realistic switching devices have been built, which combine 
cut-through and store-and-forward modes of switching; models were studied for 
von Neumann's and Moore's neighborhoods. For modeling rectangular structures, 
the infinite Petri net models have been developed and investigated. Based on the 
parametric expression of square lattice models, infinite systems of linear homogenous 
equations have been derived. The constructed models are the place invariant Petri nets 
for any given size of square lattice."
