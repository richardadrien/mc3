  talk: "Complexity of the resolution of univariate polynomial equations over finite discrete dynamical systems"
  abstract: "The computational complexity of the resolution of polynomial
equations of the form P(X) = B in the semiring of finite discrete
dynamical system (FDDS) is largely open. Indeed, even if we have
already shown that this is NP-hard in the general case, we do not have
such a result when the number of variables in the equation is bounded,
irrespective of the value of the bound.
Even worse, this is also the case for monomial equations. In other
words, we do not know the complexity of the resolution of the equation
AX^k = B.

Nevertheless, recent results prove that solving A X^k = B is in
polynomial time if the solution respects certain conditions like
connectivity. Also, it is proved that the resolution of A X = B is in
polynomial time if A is cancellable (contains a connected component
with a fixed point). Common features of these kinds of equations are
that they are univariate and their number of solutions is at most one.
For this reason, we would like to know if the following assertion is
correct: if the number of solutions of the equation P(X) = B is at
most one then we can solve it in polynomial time.

A first step towards an answer is proving that this property is
verified in the case of injective polynomial functions, and I will
prove this result in this talk."

  talk: "Qu'est-ce qu'un réseau Booléen ?"
  abstract: "Les réseaux Booléens modélisent des réseaux d’interaction, où chaque entité a un état Booléen 
  et une fonction Booléenne qui met à jour ce dernier. On peut voir un réseau Booléen de plusieurs façons 
  différentes, chacune amenant des questions et des constructions intéressantes ; c’est sans doute l’un des 
  aspects les plus excitants de la recherche dans ce domaine. Dans cet exposé, nous donnerons un aperçu de 
  certaines de ces visions : un réseau Booléen est une transformation de l’ensemble {0,1}^n, de l’hypercube 
  de dimension n, du treillis Booléen de hauteur n, de l’espace vectoriel GF(2)^n, ou même du corps fini 
  GF(2^n)... Aucune connaissance préalable des réseaux Booléens n’est requise."

  talk: "Développement d'un protocole pour l'échange de clé quantique et intégration à une bibliothèque"
  abstract: "Le projet consiste à développer un protocole pour étendre la portée des systèmes d'échange 
  de clé quantiques. Ces derniers étant limités à environ 100 km, nous souhaitons mettre en place un système 
  de relais qui permettrait de faire passer des morceaux de clé cryptographique au travers de plusieurs liens 
  quantiques en parallèle. Finalement les utilisateurs pourront reconstruire une clé cryptographique commune 
  à partir des morceaux qu'ils ont reçu des différents relais. Nous souhaiterions enfin proposer une vérification 
  formelle du protocole cryptographique, puis une intégration de ce dernier à une bibliothèque logicielle afin de 
  proposer une encapsulation transparente pour l'utilisateur."

  talk: "Well distributed occurrences property in infinite words"
  abstract: "In this talk, I will present a new abelian-type property of infinite words, 
  so-called well distributed occurrences property. We will discuss how infinite words satisfying 
  this property can be used to produce aperiodic pseudorandom number generators with good statistical behavior. 
  We study the well distributed occurrences property for certain families of  infinite words including words 
  generated by morphisms, Sturmian words and Arnoux–Rauzy words."

  talk: "Community detection in directed graphs using stationary distribution 
and hitting times methods (with Tien Dat Dang, Duy Hieu Do)"
  abstract: "Community detection has been extensively developed using various
algorithms. One of the most powerful algorithms for undirected graphs
is Walktrap, which determines the distance between vertices by
employing random walk and evaluates clusters using modularity based on
vertex degrees. Although several directions have been explored to
extend this method to directed graphs, none of them have been
effective. In this paper, we investigate the Walktrap algorithm (Pons
and Latapy in J Graph Algorithms Appl 10:191–218, 2006) and the
spectral method (Newman in Phys Rev E 88:042822, 2013) and extend them
to directed graphs. We propose a novel approach in which the distance
between vertices is defined using hitting time, and modularity is
computed based on the stationary distribution of a random walk. These
definitions are highly effective, as algorithms for hitting time and
stationary distribution have been developed, allowing for good
computational complexity. Our proposed method is particularly useful
for directed graphs, with the well-known results for undirected graphs
being special cases. Additionally, we utilize the spectral method for
these problems, and we have implemented our algorithms to demonstrate
their plausibility and effectiveness."

  talk: "Verification of Square Lattices with Various Neighborhoods by Infinite Petri Nets"
  abstract: "Different types of square lattice abstract structures with various 
neighborhoods and edge conditions are basic constructs in many real-life areas 
like telecommunications, computing, nanotechnologies, and biological systems. 
Detailed models of realistic switching devices have been built, which combine 
cut-through and store-and-forward modes of switching; models were studied for 
von Neumann's and Moore's neighborhoods. For modeling rectangular structures, 
the infinite Petri net models have been developed and investigated. Based on the 
parametric expression of square lattice models, infinite systems of linear homogenous 
equations have been derived. The constructed models are the place invariant Petri nets 
for any given size of square lattice."
